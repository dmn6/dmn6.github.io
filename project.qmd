# Introduction

Our project matters because studying average global IQ scores per country will give insight into the cognitive ability of populations around the world. This information can help researchers and policymakers understand the distribution of intellectual abilities on a global scale.

Intelligence is often linked to economic productivity and social well-being. Analyzing IQ data can help researchers explore the relationship between average IQ scores and economic indicators, such as GDP per capita, employment rates, and innovation.

Our project is about bringing awareness to the educational system and how it needs to be improved globally.

# Data

## Data Summary

```{r}
skim(IQ)
```

## Data Visualization

```{r}
ggplot(data = IQ) +
 geom_boxplot(aes(x = Continent, y = (`Average IQ`)))

```

```{r}
ggplot(data = IQ)+
  geom_point (aes( x= `Literacy Rate`, y = `Mean years of schooling - 2021`, color = Continent))+
  geom_smooth(aes( x= `Literacy Rate`, y = `Mean years of schooling - 2021`))
  
```

-   From the first graph you'll notice differences in the average IQ of each continent. In the second graph a possible reason as to why this could be happening is focused upon. It shows that in continents with low average IQ's there is generally less schooling.

## Data Transformation

```{r}
Top10 <- IQ %>% 
  group_by(Country, `Nobel Prices`)%>% 
  summarize(`Nobel Prices`) %>%
  filter(`Nobel Prices` >5) %>% 
  arrange(desc(`Nobel Prices`))
  
```

```{r}
#| results: asis
#| echo: false
rmarkdown::paged_table(Top10) 
```


```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: IQ Scores
#| fig-cap: "IQ Scores"
#| fig-width: 1
